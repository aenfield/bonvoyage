These are too big for Git, w/o using Git LFS. Instead, pull the 2017.zip file from https://1drv.ms/u/s!Atp5A_bkmwjwu9FqWn1w7TMuVQG9UA. Unzip into this directory to create 12 files, one for each month.

Lookup tables
These come from the BTS site, when you choose fields - see the 'Get Lookup Table' links on the right.

Airport lat/lon 
This comes from openflight.org, here: https://openflights.org/data.html.
